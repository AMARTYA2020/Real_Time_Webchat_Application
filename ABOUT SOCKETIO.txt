Websockets:
what if we store in a Database and keep retriving information form there
Websockets very useful for solving problem of https response
Whenever we send request from a website and get response in return We(Client) are not always connected with server
If we want a real time application then there must be strong link between client and server so as server can also push update
HTTP Request cannot connect server client (NOT POSSIBLE IN HTTP PROTOCOL) 

Websocket makes two way communication
like http & https
similarly here:
  ws & wss (Web socket secure protocol)




We implement with Socketio of Nodejs




1st Description:
 we simply make an interface chat type application in analogous to whatsapp using HTML and CSS

2nd Description:
 we create another folder for backend purpose using nodeserver.... (typing npm init) just after installing Nodejs in the built in terminal of VS code

install npm i socket.io in the builtin terminal of VS code

we create two websites  client.js and Nodejs(index.js)as a backend..basically we need to make connection between them


in HTML page we use script src (/socket.io/socket.io.js)  FROM SOCKETIO DOCUMENTATION ! //including a javascript file basically
